This is a machine learning model created using the scikit-learn library in python. It uses a random forest algorithm to detect the emotion a person is feeling based on an image of said person. To run this program, you can first run "run_recognition.py" to create the model, and then run "test_model.py" to test it. If you'd like to run it using your camera, you can run the "live_test.py" file, and you can press "q" to end the live test.
